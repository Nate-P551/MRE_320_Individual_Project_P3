# MRE_320_Individual_Project_P3
for this project we had to measure the various static characteristics of a sensor we were given
to do this we were tasked with first creating a report to summarize the basic principles and theory behind the sensors we were given
then we had to choose which static characteristics were the most important for our given sensor, explain why and produce testing plans to test the given characteristics
and with this report we also had to give the wiring diagram and arduino code used to run our sensor

we then had to run through our testing methods and find the static characteristics we had chosen through our various testing methods
once we had collected the necessary data, we had to compile it into a presentation we had to give to our class in which we explained the sensor itself, how it worked,
the various important characteristics and how we tested for them, and finally we had to compare them to how the manufacture says they are supposed to work

then we had to compile all of our findings and reports and presentations and create this GitHub repository for all of our findings to be shared with the rest of the class
